Dear Vic,

Happy Birthday!

Wow, what a wonderful year. It's been marvellous and a privilege getting to know you and seeing you grow and triumph in so many ways. Please accept my wishes of many more years of ever increasing awesomeness.

Love,

Leo

This git repo is the virtual part of a Bright Green Spime.

Please consider it a part of your Bright Green Future Filled With Spimes.

Hopefully you already have the physical part of the spime. If not, then please 
clone this repo and then build the files with 

git submodule update --recursive --init
python build.py

And then print the .stl with a RepRap style 3D printer using luminous green PLA for the box and black PLA for the inlays.

Dependencies:
python (2.7)
OpenSCAD (head of master as of 2014-10-10, probably built with bleeding edge clang - or some other compiler - instead of gcc 4.8.2) 
A working two material 3D print system.
