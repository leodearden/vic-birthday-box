This git repo is the virtual part of a Bright Green Spime.

Please consider it a part of your Bright Green Future Filled With Spimes.

Hopefully you already have the physical part of the spime. If not, then please 
build the files with 

git submodule update --recursive --init
python build.py

And then print the .stl with a RepRap style 3D printer using luminous green PLA.
